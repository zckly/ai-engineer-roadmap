# AI Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to the comprehensive AI Engineer Roadmap! This guide is designed to help you navigate the exciting and rapidly evolving field of AI engineering. Whether you're just starting out or looking to expand your skills, this roadmap covers essential topics and provides resources to support your learning journey.

## Table of Contents
1. [Web/App Development](#webapp-development)
2. [Beginner Text Generation](#beginner-text-generation)
3. [Advanced Text Generation](#advanced-text-generation)
4. [Image Generation](#image-generation)
5. [Speech](#speech)
6. [Computer Vision](#computer-vision)

## 0. Web/App Development

It helps to have the ability to code your own interfaces, but it's also 100% possible to build AI products without knowing how to program. It's up to you if you wanna go down the coding (full-stack) route or no-code (Webflow, Zapier, etc) route.

### Full-stack Route (recommended)
- **Front-end**: Learn React for building interactive user interfaces
- **Back-end**: Master NodeJS/NextJS for server-side development
- **Database**: Understand and implement Postgres for data storage

There are tons of roadmaps out there for learning web development. One of my favorites is [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j). I also have a [bootcamp on Youtube that covers full-stack web dev + building AI apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0VuGgPBpjM)

### No-code Route
- **Website Builder**: Explore Webflow for creating professional websites without coding
- **Workflow Builder**: Use Zapier to automate processes and integrate applications
- **Database**: Leverage Firebase or Airtable for easy-to-use, scalable data storage solutions

## Beginner Text Generation

1. **Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Watch [3Blue1Brown's Youtube series on LLMs/Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) as an entry point
   - (Bonus) Watch [Karpathy's video on building GPT from scratch](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY)

2. **Proprietary LLMs**
   - OpenAI's GPT models
   - Anthropic's Claude 3 family
   - Google's Gemini

3. **Open-source LLMs**
   - Meta's LLaMA 3
   - Cohere's Command-R

4. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Study [Anthropic's Prompting Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview)

5. **Basic Chatbots**
   - Explore [Vercel's AI Library documentation](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction)
   - Project: Create a poem generator

6. **Handling Structured Output**
   - Learn techniques for generating and parsing structured data from LLMs

## Advanced Text Generation

1. **Function Calling and Tool Usage**
   - Implement LLM-powered tools and integrate external functions

2. **Web-browsing Capabilities**
   - Project: Build an open-source version of Perplexity (like [morph.so](https://morph.so))

3. **Fine-tuning LLMs**
   - Techniques for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks

4. **Embeddings and Vector Databases**
   - Understand and implement vector representations of text
   - Explore vector database solutions for efficient similarity search

5. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Project: Develop a "Chat with PDF" application

6. **AI Agents**
   - Study projects like OpenDevin to understand autonomous AI systems

## Image Generation

1. **Prompt Engineering for Image Generation**
   - Learn art history and photography terminology to craft effective prompts

2. **Proprietary Image Generation Models**
   - Explore capabilities of models like GPT-4V (OpenAI)

3. **Open-source Image Generation Models**
   - Experiment with Stable Diffusion and other accessible models

## Speech

1. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
   - Implement TTS using services like ElevenLabs

2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
   - Utilize models like OpenAI's Whisper for transcription
   - Project: Create a job interview coach application

3. **Speech Analysis**
   - Explore emotion and intent analysis using tools like Hume AI or Google Gemini 1.5 Pro

## Computer Vision

1. **Image Analysis**
   - Leverage models like Claude or GPT-4V for comprehensive image understanding

2. **Video Analysis**
   - Explore advanced capabilities with models like Google Gemini 1.5 Pro
