## Web/App Development

Choose between two routes based on your coding experience and project requirements:

### Coding Route
- **Front-end**: Learn React for building interactive user interfaces
- **Back-end**: Master NodeJS/NextJS for server-side development
- **Database**: Understand and implement Postgres for data storage

### No-coding Route
- **Website Builder**: Explore Webflow for creating professional websites without coding
- **Workflow Builder**: Use Zapier to automate processes and integrate applications
- **Database**: Leverage Firebase or Airtable for easy-to-use, scalable data storage solutions
