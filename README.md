# AI Engineer Roadmap

*The fastest, most comprehensive way to become an AI Engineer in 2024*

Welcome to the AI Engineer Roadmap! This guide offers a project-based approach to mastering AI engineering, whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your skills. Each section includes practical projects to apply your knowledge, build real-world AI applications, and develop crucial problem-solving skills ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ

## Web/App Development

It helps to have the ability to code your own interfaces, but it's also 100% possible to build AI products without knowing how to program. It's up to you if you wanna go down the coding (full-stack) route or no-code (Webflow, Zapier, etc) route.

### Full-stack Route (recommended)
- **Front-end**: Learn React for building interactive user interfaces
- **Back-end**: Master NodeJS/NextJS for server-side development
- **Database**: Understand and implement Postgres for data storage

There are tons of roadmaps out there for learning web development. One of my favorites is [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j). I also have a [bootcamp on Youtube that covers full-stack web dev + building AI apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0VuGgPBpjM)

### No-code Route
- **Website Builder**: Explore Webflow for creating professional websites without coding
- **Workflow Builder**: Use Zapier to automate processes and integrate applications
- **Database**: Leverage Firebase or Airtable for easy-to-use, scalable data storage solutions

## Beginner Text Generation

1. **Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)**
   - Watch [3Blue1Brown's Youtube series on LLMs/Transformers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) as an entry point
